title: How I stay healthy as a work-from-home software engineer
---

I began working fully remote about three years ago. Here are the main things I have done to stay healthy while working this kind of job.

### Ergonomics

I invested early in ergonomics to make sure that I don't end up with finger, wrist, or shoulder problems later in my career. I bought a [MoErgo Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/pages/glove80) keyboard, which I use at work every day. It is super comfortable. The learning curve for this kind of keyboard was not as bad as I thought it would be. Within a couple days I was back at what I would consider to be an acceptable typing speed, and within about a month I was within about 10 wpm of my normal typing speed (about 130 on the Glove80, or 140 on a normal keyboard).

I also bought an electronic height-adjusting standing desk, so that I could dial in the height to exactly what I needed, when sitting or standing. I typically sit in the morning and stand for most of the afternoon. The desk I bought is the [FlexiSpot E7 Pro](https://www.flexispot.com/flexispot-best-standing-desk-e7pro?ref=category_products) and so far it has held up very well. I also bought a dual monitor stand from a brand called Huanuo so that I can keep my monitors high and avoiding straining my neck by looking down.

I never invested in a fancy office chair. I just bought one from a nearby home goods store that I thought was reasonably comfortable. Since I don't sit in it all day long, I don't think it causes me any ergonomic problems.

### Diet

My diet is quite simple. I try to minimize processed foods and prioritize eating real food. I very rarely eat at restaurants and I never get food delivered. Almost everything that I eat I either cook at home, or if it's at church, it was cooked by other families in the church. This also helps me save money, since the price of restaurant meals has really gone up in recent years. I also try to eat more protein than what the government used to recommend.

For snacking, I like eating apples, raw almonds, and frozen blueberries. Most of my protein is chicken and eggs, but I have some beef also. My most common carbs are white rice and pasta.

### Exercise

I'm not a gym bro and I do all my exercise at home. I purchased a walking pad treadmill that is pretty small and caps out at 4 mph, but it also has feet that you can pull out to give it an incline. I'll walk on this for an extended period of time after work, sometimes while wearing a weighted vest, and that provides some good cardio exercise while also letting me focus on something else, like watching a seminary lecture. For strength training, I do body weight core exercises and resistance bands. The YouTube channel [ACHV Peak](https://www.youtube.com/@ACHVPEAK) has some helpful workouts that I follow.
