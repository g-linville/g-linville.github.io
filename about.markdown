I'm a software engineer based out of Metro Detroit, currently working for [Obot AI](https://obot.ai).

My background is in the Kubernetes and DevOps/cloud world, but for the past couple years I have been working on AI tooling and more recently in the MCP ecosystem.

I make heavy use of Claude Code in my day-to-day work and am interested to see what the future software development holds.
